# School Administration

A web app that allows school administrators to create, read, update,
and delete courses and all aspects of courses. Node.js was used to develop
the REST API and handle user authentication to ensure courses are only 
accessed by authorized users. 

## Installation

### Frontend 

Open terminal:

Step 1: `cd client`

Step 2: `npm install`

Step 3: `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode and automatically opens http://localhost:3000 in your default browser

### Backend

Open new terminal:

Step 1: `cd api`

Step 2: `npm install`

Step 3: `npm start`

This starts the REST API.

To access REST API without using frontend, it can be accessed on http://localhost:5000
